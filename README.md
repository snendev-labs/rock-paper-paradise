# Rock Paper Paradise

A simple roguelike prototype built from the premise of Rock-Paper-Scissors-7 (that is, Rock-Paper-Scissors with 7 elements). Players select between Rock, Water, Air, Paper, Scissors, and Fire "elements" to defeat the mysterious opponent.

After defeating each enemy, players are given the chance to either upgrade these elements to improve the payout received from various outcomes or to advance towards victory by incorporating another of the 7 elements into both the player and the enemy's options.

This is only a prototype, and hopefully will have a lot more polish later on.
